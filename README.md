**SmartThings - The Heart of Your Smart Home**

SmartThings lets you control and monitor your home using your smartphone from anywhere in the world. You can secure your home for a fraction of the cost of a traditional home security system; stay connected to loved ones wherever you are; save money on energy costs; and control and automate lights, locks, temperature, electronics, and more to create a smart home that automatically reacts to your preferences and gives you peace of mind.

Once you download the free SmartThings app, you can use your smartphone as a remote to monitor and control all of the smart lights, locks, cameras, appliances, and other sensors in your home from wherever you are. The SmartThings Hub acts as a messenger. When your connected devices have important things to tell you (“Sara’s home!” “Someone left the front door open!” “There’s unexpected motion by the back door!”), the Hub will relay that information to your smartphone. As long as you have a Hub, you can add as many SmartThings-compatible devices as you like to create a fully connected home.

Ethernet-connected Hub plugs directly into your Internet router and supports ZigBee, Z-Wave as well as IP-accessible devices. It includes a power cord and is compatible with hundreds of smart devices today and even more in the future.

**RainMachine - The WiFi Forecast Sprinkler. Conserve water.**

The RainMachine sprinkler controller automatically adjusts your watering amount by lowering it on rainy or colder days and increasing it on hot summer days. The system not only saves water but it also protects your plants. The versatility of each program is unprecedented: select individual weekdays, Even/Odd day mode, Cycle and Soak, or Station Delay. Run the programs one-at-a-time, sequentially or even in parallel! The RainMachine WIFI sprinkler timer is designed to handle possible conflicts, like simultaneous commands to the same valve or overlapping schedules.

Your RainMachine sprinkler controller connects via WIFI and gets the best weather data available on earth. NOAA employs satellites, radars, weather stations and highly qualified meteorologists, delivering the most accurate weather forecast on the planet. Complex mathematical models that run on huge data centers are free for you to use in your garden. Yes, free, already paid from your tax money. Using your exact street location, the RainMachine sprinkler timer downloads precise weather data, accommodating to specific micro-climates. Let it rain!

When no forecast data is available the RainMachine will automatically switch to historical weather statistics. This way the RainMachine conserves water even if the Internet goes down.
